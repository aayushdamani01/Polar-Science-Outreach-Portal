// Phase 5 — Adaptive Asset Quality for expedition photos, plus the later
// adaptive-download addition on top of it.
//
// Scope is deliberately narrow: the only bandwidth-heavy, network-fetched
// asset in the client (besides the globe textures, already handled in
// Phase 4) is the photo grid in the expedition detail panel. Reports are
// download links, datasets are parsed tables, videos show a static
// placeholder with no image fetch — none of those need this, and none of
// this ever touches those file types.
//
// This never creates or stores a new file. Cloudinary transformations are
// applied on the fly by editing the URL, so the same uploaded photo serves
// a different byte size depending on the viewer's connection.

// Cloudinary URLs look like:
//   https://res.cloudinary.com/<cloud>/image/upload/<existing transforms>/<version+public_id>
// Cloudinary applies chained transformation components (separated by "/")
// in the order they appear, and the LAST one wins on final dimensions. The
// existing thumbnailUrl/fileUrl already has an eager c_fill,h_400,w_400
// crop baked in as its first component — so our transform must be inserted
// AFTER that component, not before it, or that pre-existing crop silently
// overrides our width and only the quality/format change actually lands.
// If a URL doesn't look like a Cloudinary upload URL at all, this returns
// it untouched rather than guessing — a plain original image is always
// safer than a broken transform.

// Cloudinary's implicit default matching 'scale' behavior.

//
// 'cached-only' deliberately reuses the SLOW transform rather than building
// its own: the service worker's runtime image cache (sw.js) is keyed by
// exact request URL, so requesting a URL variant that's never been fetched
// before is a guaranteed miss while fully offline. Reusing SLOW's URL means
// if the researcher passed through a low-bandwidth connection recently,
// this is the version most likely already sitting in that cache.
